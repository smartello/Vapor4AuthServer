# VaporAuthServer
The intention of this work is to create a JWT based auth server for swift decoupled from database, email agent and etc.

The project is in the active development phase right now: tests don't pass (and barely present), there's more coupling than needed, some useless packages and it's a ready-to-use vapor app which is not a final goal. Ultimately, it must be a package that one will set as a dependency, map routes and start their own app.

Refer to the Projects page to figure out what is goint on.
